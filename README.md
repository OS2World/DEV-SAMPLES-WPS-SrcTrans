# DEV-SAMPLES-WPS-SrcTrans
This small offering shows how to perform a source rendered drag/drop in the  WPS of OS/2.  All drag/drop operations performed in the WPS are target rendered, so you have no control if you are coding a WPS class which needs to be part of the rendering in such an operation.
